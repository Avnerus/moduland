Sketch for the MPU9250 9 DoF motion sensor including open-source sensor fusion using either the Madgwick or Mahony algorithms. The breakout board I use is [this](https://www.tindie.com/products/onehorse/mpu9250-teensy-3x-add-on-shields/) one which also has the excellent MS5637 pressure/temperature sensor. This can provide an additional estimate of altitude accurate to a foot or so.
