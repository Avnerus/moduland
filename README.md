# Moduland
Moduland is an open-source, interactive playground that was created by the Playful Machines that Make Music track, during the [2018 MIT Media Lab Berlin workshop](https://www.media.mit.edu/events/mlberlin-signalandnoise/). The project consists of a playground kit that is built using Node.js and hardware sensors. See the team's [project website](https://medialabmoduland.wordpress.com/) for more information.
